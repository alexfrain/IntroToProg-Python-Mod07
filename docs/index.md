# Exception Handling and Pickling

## Introduction
This week’s assignment focused on two key concepts, exception handling and working with binary data files using Python’s pickle module.  These topics were introduced during class this week but the assignment had us doing our own Internet research to get a better understanding.  With the research in hand we were given a blank slate for the script and asked to demonstrate both concepts using examples of our choice.  The script I created is a weekly budget entry script where the user enters their purchases for the week (this is basically a modified version of the home inventory script from earlier in the quarter).  The user loops through the script entering an items purchased with their associated cost, each data pair is dictionary, and each dictionary item is added to a list.  Exception handling is added to account for the possibility of incorrect data being input by the user.  Once the user is done adding items the list is then added to a new list along with a float variable holding the total amount spent that week.  This new list is written to a binary file and then it’s read back into the script all through the use of the pickle module.
